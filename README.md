# Hello Node!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it.
It just serves static files stored in the project's public folder.
Note that all other code outside of this folder (e.g. what's in server.js) is not visible to the general public.
Unlike front-end JavaScript, back-end code is not sent to the browser.
Instead, back-end code can be used to generate pages and responses to send to a browser (client) in response to specific requests.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.
This project uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
Please do not upgrade to Express version 5, which is incompatible with the version of node.js that Glitch uses.

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript.
If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `public/client.js`: The JavaScript for the site's front-end. This is the JavaScript that will run in the user's (client's) web browser.

‚Üê `public/index.html`: This is the main index for the site. In other Glitch examples, you may see HTML templates with libraries like Handlebars instead of an index.html

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. In this template, we just use this to serve files, but we'll build on this in other examples.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

Note: this is a template developed by Glitch and uses Fastify instead of Express.
Both libraries are similar in function, but have different syntax.
